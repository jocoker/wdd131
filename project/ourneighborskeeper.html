            Our Neighbor's Keeper is a Nonprofit organization built on the idea 
            that you can make a big influence in the lives of others through a 
            series of small and simple acts. Our all-volunteer labor force means 
            your donations go directly to those with the greatest need. Our vision 
            is to provide peace of mind and the comforts of home to our neighbors 
            in need in Jackson. We provide free furniture and household goods to 
            prevously homeless families and others in similar situations. We offer 
            support, advocacy, and referrals to those in need. We are also a thrift 
            store with great stuff at amazing prices that we sell to help us further 
            our mission.
